# To Trust or not to Trust - Exploring: Trustworthiness in Multi-Agent Systems

Interaction is a crucial component of Multi-Agents Systems (MAS), that enables each individual agent
to collect necessary information to solve its own task (Parhizkar, Nikravan, Holte, & Zilles, 2020). To
ensure effective collaboration between agents, they need to evaluate how trustworthy are the other
agents in the system. During this evaluation, agents base their choices on direct and indirect trust.
The former type of trust refers to results from an agentâ€™s direct interaction with another agent, the
latter is based on recommendations from other, potentially dishonest agents
